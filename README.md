# HTML Learning Project
This project contains the basics of HTML that I learned during the first week of my HTML course.
The project includes two HTML files (index.html and about.html), a CSS file (main.css), and various images.

## Project Content

- **index.html
This page showcases the fundamental concepts and techniques I learned in HTML. The page includes:

Header and Navigation Menu: The top section of the page contains a header and a navigation menu that allows quick access to different sections of the page.

List Examples: Includes examples of both ordered and unordered lists.

Images and Captions: Features sections with images of countries I want to visit and short captions describing them.

Daily Schedule Table: A table that displays my daily schedule, used as an example to practice HTML table structures.

Contact Form: A simple form where users can input their name, surname, phone number, and select their favorite coffee.

- **about.html
This page contains a brief introduction about me. It also includes examples like downloading a favicon, sending an email, and dialing a phone number.

- **main.css
This file is a simple CSS stylesheet used to style the HTML pages. It includes basic style definitions for background color, text color, link styles, and table structures.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5: For structuring the web pages and content.
- **CSS3: For styling and enhancing the visual appearance of the pages.
